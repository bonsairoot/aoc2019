# Advent of code
## What is aoc?
Advent of code is a daily challenge lasting throughout the Advent time.  
See: <http://adventofcode.com/> for more informations.  
There is also a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) where people are posting and discussing their solutions.

## What is my strategy?
I am not participating with the goal to get as many points as possible. I will probably miss quite a lot of days and post  
my solutions rather late in the day. The main goal is to get more familiar with interesting languages and to improve my coding  
skills in general.

## What languages am I using and why?
Usually I try to use a couple of different languages from different programming paradigms. This year I'm looking at: 

- **Haskell**  
  - Learning Haskell is something that has been on my todo-list for a while now. Due to lack of time I couldn't use it as much as I would've liked in previous years.
- **Rust**
  - I have not used Rust in a while even though I like the language.
- **Python3**    
  - Fun and easy language for the days where I'm strapped for time.
- **Perl**    
  - Anything related to heavy text processing might end up being written in Perl.
- **Kotlin**
  - I have never written any code in Kotlin but I have used Java here and there. This may be a good opportunity to try it out.

## Feedback
If any scripts look like a huge mess it's probably because I've rushed them and didn't have the time and/or motivation for refactoring.
I will revisit them and do some cleanup at some point. Feel free to give me feedback on my solutions if you see me posting in the subreddit. I appreciate every advice given to me.
